<h1>DRT-A Novel Tool for Data Archiving</h1>

<div>
  <b>Introduction</b>  
  <p>
    Databases are essential across IT domains for efficient data storage and retrieval, facilitating smooth operations and informed decision-making in businesses, healthcare, 
    finance, logistics, and more. The rapid increase in data generation leads to challenges in processing and retrieving data, resulting in slower performance and higher operational costs. 
    To enhance database performance, techniques such as indexing, partitioning, caching, query optimization, and others are employed. This paper focuses on partitioning techniques to manage large data volumes, 
    specifically referencing the "DRT-A Novel Tool for Data Archiving" paper. The DRT uses the Near Replica Rapid Deletion (NRRD) algorithm for efficient data removal in Oracle databases, significantly outperforming 
    conventional SQL Delete methods. The paper highlights the success of DRT in reducing system load and deletion time, demonstrated through its application in a major airline. However, the original study was limited 
    to Oracle's PL-SQL environment, and this paper will extend the research by testing the NRRD algorithm's performance in MySQL.

  <b>Objective</b>  
  <p>This algorithem has been implemented in PLSQL environment. Hence the objective of this project is to apply this algorithem and check its efficiency in other RDBMS. And
  for this project, MySQL has been used
